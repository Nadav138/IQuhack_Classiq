2024 hackathon
Max distance -> 0.07

We do a piecewise linear approximation of tanh function in the interval [0,1). 

We divide the interval into 4 equal sub-intervals and approximate the function there. For a precision of 4 for |x>, we can output |x>|p(x)> with 24 qubits with l_{inf} norm cost 0.07. 

For a precision of 20 for |x>, the same algorithm can work with 100 qubits. 
We won the first prize!
